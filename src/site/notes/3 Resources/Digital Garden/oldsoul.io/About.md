You've stumbled upon my "digital garden" of sorts: a curated collection of my singular thoughts and cumulative ideas that I tend like heirloom seeds and their resulting foliage. Maybe one day they will bear fruit, but that's not necessarily my purpose in tending this garden. Sometimes just seeing the foliage and flowers unfurl is reward enough to the casual gardener like myself. Any resulting fruit will be a bonus for the passers-by who visit.

Who am I? I'm known by many online as "Oldsoul," and I rather like the moniker. I don't try to hide who I am; I simply don't broadcast it, either. [[3 Resources/Digital Garden/oldsoul.io/I'm just me|I'm just me]], and that's neither here nor there as it pertains to this digital garden: its yield is not affected by the identity of its gardener.

This collection of working notes, my digital garden as it were, is published here because I believe all thoughts and ideas matter in some way, even if incomplete or initially wrong. If they don't make sense to you, it's probably because they are my own thoughts in my own head, and not written for any specific audience. Therefore, you may lack the context in which the thought or idea was borne, and that's okay. Maybe it will trigger your own thought or idea.

If you came here to learn about the gardener, I'll offer you this note:
I'm an old soul in a comparatively young-ish body. I often confuse people because I love being alone in my solitude, though I seem to be a social butterfly. I actively seek to empathize with others and see life from their perspective, even when I know I disagree with them personally. I often feel a sense of alienation or strangeness as my beliefs and desires become misaligned with the majority of people around me: and that's okay. I enjoy the little things in life and no longer feel the need to be high-maintenance. I struggle in some small degree with a sense of self-importance in that I don't care what most people think of me, but I want to be valued by and important to those who matter most to me.

I'm Oldsoul, and it's nice to meet you.
