# I'm Just Me
Who I am and what I do is of little importance in the grand scheme of life, as I see it. It is of less importance to the thoughts I glean and the ideas I formulate from them.

Thoughts and ideas have merit and intrinsic value, whether good or bad, great or small, and I simply want to share the ones I believe to be worth sharing. Who I am or what I do stands independent of that, or at least it should. I oftentimes find that others are fond of discounting a thought or idea simply because of who put it forth, rather than by its own value or merit. They shy from quoting someone with whom they otherwise disagree or disassociate, for example. 

For the above reasons, I minimize "me" and prefer to magnify the thoughts or ideas that I haveâ€”which may trigger your own thoughts and ideas independent of my own and apart from who I am. That has more value to me than your thoughts of me or what I do or have done.

For example, I may put forth the thought that helping others is good. I may present the idea that many individuals working together for the common good is even better. But then I may somehow or at some time act selfishly or against the common good in a way that taints my public image. Who I am as a person and what I do of my own volition would not negate the thought or devalue the ideas I put forth, but it is not uncommon to find those who would destroy any good to be found among the thoughts or ideas on account of my actions. So this is why I want a place to publish them without making it about me.

As I see it, it is no different than telling someone to judge a book by its content instead of its cover, or to judge a religion by its teachings instead of the behavior of its followers (which may or may not actually adhere closely to those teachings).

So I'm just me: a flawed human being with carnal desires, spiritual objectives, and a divine ambition. I have a past, I have a present, and I have a future, all cumulative of the choices I make and actions I take. But my thoughts and ideas, like your own, have intrinsic value that stands apart from all of that. And I hope you think on these things and create your own ideas from them. This is the purpose of my digital garden: take seedlings and cuttings as you will, plant your own garden, tend to it with zeal, and see what flourishes.

Happy gardening!
